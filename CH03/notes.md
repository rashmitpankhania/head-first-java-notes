### so here we start out new chapter 3 about variables

one importtnt thing is about primitve variable and the reference  variable 
primitive variable sounds like the traditional ones 
***Be Careful Bears shouldnt ingest Large Furry Dogs***
its a good way to remember them and what it actually means is 
1. Byte
2. Char
3. Boolean
4. short
5. int
6. long
7. float
8. double 
***Its like APIE remember ?***
**Abstraction Polymorphism Inheritance Encapsulation**
it was a good book

whenever we create object i always thought that its is the actual object but today found it was ***object reference***
and the example is also quite good..

onw huge blow is also that ***array is an object!!! yes***

### sharpen your pencil
1. null
2. pets[3] = pets[2];

***implicit widening***
we can put a byte in an int **more to learn in next part**

### be the compiler
1. A will compile but will not run cause only references are create not objects
2. I think B will aslo compile but will create error because of the memory spillage error

### pool puzzle
triangle 0, area = 4.0
triangle 1, area = 10.0
triangle 2, area = 18.0
triangle 3, area = 28.0
y = 4, t5 area = 343.0
