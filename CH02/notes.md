So the chapter is "A trip to objectville now this looks quite intereting cause after all it just about OOPs pretty excited btw.

### Now we will create game kind of loosy game applicatioon in which a player guess the number and whoever is corect wins the game

## interesting to learn that java uses the **HEAP** methodology for the memory allocation and optimisatiion and all the objects that are created and that are now reeavhble they are gone to **Garbage Collectible Heap** sounds cool right!!

# And after that when the system runs low on meemory it uses the garbage collectible heap to use the meomory
# it was something new by the way

### dumb question thingy
1. There is no such thing as global or constant varible if you want you can use it as the *Public, Static or final* which is interesting
