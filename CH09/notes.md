New chapterrr baby and yes listening to one of the beautiful....Perfect by Ed Sheeeran!1

*Warning this chapter contains the material about the death if object so dont get too attached to that*

simly awesome..see this is how i like to start a neww chapter

two areas of memory
1. for objects created is the **HEAP**
2. for the method invocations and local variables is the **STACK**

and about the objects in the method we shou;d remember that the actual object stays in the heap and the object reference goes to stack...
the object always always **ALWAYS** goes on the heap

the dumb question is pretyy obviouss :)) lohl
ohk so STACK and HEAP coooool

now that  we know where our variable live
that is objects live on the heaps always
and the method which has the non primitive type only store the value of the refrence

theonly way to invoke the constructor is with the keyword ***new*** followed by the name of the class
every class has a **CONSTRUCTOR** which instantiates the object

we can call the constructor within the the constructor..how cool is that??
ooooooh...and we dont have to write the constructor...obvio we can but if we dont then the compiler writes for you....hawww!!


owww so we can write our own like that

##Sharpen your pencil
1. for sure the counter to see how many objects 
2. create has -a objects
3. assign values to the objects instance variable
