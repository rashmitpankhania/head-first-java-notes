Ahhhh good old new chapter it feels so fresshhhh

and also i have written in the beginning of the other chapter also that the introduction of the chapter mannnnn thats the thinggg!!!!!

listing to Karmin - Brokenhearted i have beeen waiting all dayyy...!! :)

## brain power
hmm...designing tiger and cat...pretty cool and funny also
i guess the parent class will be a animal with instance varibale like name place age
and cat and tiger will inherit from them and will have specific instance variable like wild or forest something like thayt

instance variable are not overridden

## designing an inheritance teree
it was really good to find out that how the jvm actuallly finds out which method to call out of all the inheritance and overriding
so the thing actually is the jvm goind looking at lowest part of the inheritance tree and check if any method is avaiklanle or not if not and then it goes above it and execute if it finds that else loop continues till the root of the class

##sharpen your pencil - create relationship of the inheritance tree
musician will be the parentclass and will have the subclasses i.e
Fan will be the separate  one
Rockstar will inherit musician so as the base pianist and bass player

##there are no dumb questions
good thing to find out that jvm will always find the match to callable method thanks to compiler who always check if it is defined or not
compiler doesnt care when in which classs the method is but jvm always pick the right one the lowest one

##is-a has-a test
wow this is a wonderfull test to check our design

## sharpen your pencil - check relationships

hm a good question i think...if a superclass wants to use the subclass versionof method then..??seems not possiblle is it a limitation??
***super.method() actually runs the method whhich is defined in superclass not completey replacing it*** wow didnt know that
and btw the song Capital Cities - Safe and Sound is really good

whoa didnt know that private members cannot be inherited thats really important
four different access modifiers are there : private default protected public not three
