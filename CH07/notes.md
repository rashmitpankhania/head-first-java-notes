Ahhhh good old new chapter it feels so fresshhhh

and also i have written in the beginning of the other chapter also that the introduction of the chapter mannnnn thats the thinggg!!!!!

listing to Karmin - Brokenhearted i have beeen waiting all dayyy...!! :)

## brain power
hmm...designing tiger and cat...pretty cool and funny also
i guess the parent class will be a animal with instance varibale like name place age
and cat and tiger will inherit from them and will have specific instance variable like wild or forest something like thayt

instance variable are not overridden

## designing an inheritance teree
it was really good to find out that how the jvm actuallly finds out which method to call out of all the inheritance and overriding
so the thing actually is the jvm goind looking at lowest part of the inheritance tree and check if any method is avaiklanle or not if not and then it goes above it and execute if it finds that else loop continues till the root of the class

##sharpen your pencil - create relationship of the inheritance tree
musician will be the parentclass and will have the subclasses i.e
Fan will be the separate  one
Rockstar will inherit musician so as the base pianist and bass player

##there are no dumb questions
good thing to find out that jvm will always find the match to callable method thanks to compiler who always check if it is defined or not
compiler doesnt care when in which classs the method is but jvm always pick the right one the lowest one

##is-a has-a test
wow this is a wonderfull test to check our design

## sharpen your pencil - check relationships

hm a good question i think...if a superclass wants to use the subclass versionof method then..??seems not possiblle is it a limitation??
***super.method() actually runs the method whhich is defined in superclass not completey replacing it*** wow didnt know that
and btw the song Capital Cities - Safe and Sound is really good

whoa didnt know that private members cannot be inherited thats really important
four different access modifiers are there : private default protected public not three

##polymorphism in action
i wasnt knowing that the reference of the super classs can point or can have the ibject of the subclass thats freaking awsome
and we can also make methods like that in which object reference is send in the argument and later we can send the objects of subclass

the king adevantage
***i can write code with polymorphism and the code wont change if new subclasses are added***

this lesson is surelly a lot of things
1. a class can never be private but it can be non public like package protected that is by default
2. with the help of access modifier **final** we can stop the inheritance of the particular class
3. if the classs has private constructors then also it cannot be inherited

final class is something that you are always sure the method will work your way only and you dony want toget it overriden

important thing to note is the methodis a contract that the arguments and return typr should look like exacty same as superclass
one really important thig is that the compiler looks for the refernec when inc=voking the method but the jvm need ths actual object to run the method
so if both the method are not same then the actual one willnot get called

an overloaded method has nothing to do with the inheritance and polymorphism and its just the differne t method with the same name

#be the compiler
the answer would be i guess number ***1***
