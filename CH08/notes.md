New chapterrrrrrr... name gives goosebumps..not really but yeah Serious Polymorphism
importantt thing to remember is that we can use the refrenece of the superclass to point the subclass object

the biggest statement about the interface is that **Some class should not just be instantaited** they are just meant to you know stay ther and inherit it..you know lohl!!

**when we make our class as abstract we are telling that its not meant for instantiated it just for the inheritance and the polymorphism**

abstract is antiii *concrete*

if we mark a method abstract then we have to mark the class  as abstract as well
there cannont be a concrete or non abstract class with a abstract method but
there is a possiblity that a asbtract class can have the abstaract and/or non abstract methods obviuolsy

##reason of the abstract methods 
the reason for the abstract methods is that we cannot come up with the generic code of all the subclasses to put it into the superclass so the point of the abstract method is that to use **protocol**

the whole point of the polymorphism is that ability to use the superclass as the method argument or the return type or array type

an abstract class inheriting from the abstract class can have abstract methods as well concrete methods

2. House in abstract can be for architect applicatioon and concrete in city map
3. Town in abstract can be for urban develeopment application and concrete for the sateliite view
4. Football as abstract in coaching application and player concrete in FIFA
