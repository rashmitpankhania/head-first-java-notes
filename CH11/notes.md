 new chapter Risky Behaviour!! listening to blues
 now will be creating a beatbox kind of application
 
 ## beatbox
 
 runtime exceptions are always the free pass and gets ignored by the compiler..thats really cool
 
 all exceptions that the compiler cares are called the *checked exceptions*
 
 ## sharpen your pencil
 1. access an array - runtime exception
 2. display a window on screen - i think wont throw an exception
 3. retrieve data from database - will throw anexception that data is not there
 4. see a text file - will throw exception if didnt find the location
 5. create a new file - wont thorw excepitpn
 6. read char from cmd - wont throw exception
 
 so the flow of excecution is it ignores the rest of the code and complates the below part
 
 ## sharpen your pencil
 if test is no
 
 start try
 start risky
 end risky
 end try
 finally
 end of main
 
 if test is yes
 start try
 start risky
 scary eception
 finally
 end of main
 
 a method can throw more than one exception
 
 another thing is about not making the advantage of the polymorphism its enmey that is using the Supertype Exception everytime to get the catch because it will then catch every thing
 multiple catch blockas must ordred from the samllest to largest
 
 the one with the largest class has to be at the bottom and the smallest exception has to be on the top
 
 ## sharpen your pencil
 Del -> Gamm -> Bet -> Alph
 Del & Gamm -> Bet -> Alph
 
 1. boiex
 2. Biff ex
 3. bar ex
 4. fooex
 5. bazex
 
 1. boiex
 2. bar ex
 3. biff ex
 4. foo ex
 5. baz ex
 
 two things we can do with the exceptions is
 1. handle it with try catch
 2. duck it by *throws XYZException*
 
 _try_ _catch_ and _finally_
