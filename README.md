Notes and solved tutorial of book Head First Java by Kathy Sierra &amp; Bert Bates

This book helped me to learn all those concepts that are necessary to learn not only Java but also any other programming language.

There are a total of 18 chapters each chapter covering a different topic.

Chapter 18 is about distributed computing and the changes are still in progress.

Feel free to learn and contribute also.
Happy to listen new issue for enhancement or feature.
