2. declare string varibale name with "fido"
3. declare Dog object with constructor name and size
4. doing and operation on x which is not decalred by its datatype
5. conditional statetment
6. while loop with condition checking 
7. method of the object myDog
8. closed parentheses
9. declaring the array with five elemenets
10. priunting out hekko and the Dog with name

11. again decalaring the string variavle num with "8"

12. parsing the above string into an  integere with Integer.parseInt method
