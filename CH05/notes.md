#simple dot com game
the idea is that following a way to write a class
1. prep code
2. test code
3. real code

***Extreme programming***


##simple dot com class

#prep code
declare a int array for the location say locationCells will contain the all location
declare a int for number of hits

decalre a checkYourself() method to check if user hit or not
decalre a setter method for the locationCells

checkYourself() method
take user input in string
convert user input to integer
repeat with all location cells
	if input match
		if hit is 3
			return kill
		else
			return hit
return miss

setLocationCells() method
get the location as integer araay in assigned it to locationCells
return

#test code for the methods
in the SimpleDotGame class

##sharpen your pencil
some things which we are missing in the code is that we are that
1. we are not testing all the three cells
2. not handling the proper user input that shoudl check if it is an integer or not

## sharpen your pencil: prep code for the main()
declare numOfGuesses int initailize it to zero
declare an array int[] locationCells
int startingLocation be a randomNumber between 0 and 4
another two locations will be obtained by adding one and two
so locationcells array is ready
initialize the SimpleDotGame object
set the locationCells
run the while loop in infinity mode
ask the user to input
store the output in result
increment the numOfGuesses
check if the result is kill and if it is then break
else repeat
show the numOfguesses


##note
one important thing to note about is the casting of the  data types
that is the casting works only one way that a data type with the small size can be casted into the datatype with larger size
for eg. 

##be the jvm 
13 15 x = 6
cause the value of the y was coming 13

##crossword
Across
6.extreme
17.element
18.variable
26.random
28.parseint
29.break
Down
8.loop
14.iteration
23.post
26.run
27.pre

##after looking at the answers
fancy computer word for the build is implement ...okay
pre i kno
for is a  multi part loop wow
ohhh prepecodeequ is psudo code...my bad english
change is cassssst???
the big toolkit api?? didnt get it
integer???????/
booolean is uncastableeee how could i forgettttt
expression lohl
java.io is talkative packgae good to know
as if...virtual..what??
